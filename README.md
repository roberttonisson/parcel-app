# Parcel app

This repository is home to my test assignement to Helmes.

## Requierments

This project is made in two parts. Back-End in .NET5.0 and front-end in React.ts framework using Node.js LTS. Make sure to have these installed, also database connection is required.

Download or clone this repository.

```bash
 git clone https://github.com/roberttonisson/parcel-app.git
```

# Getting back-end service to work

In commandNavigate to solution folder at

```bash
 ../ParcelSolution
```

First it is necessary to set up database server connection. You can to that in /WebApp/appsetting.json.
Application default is set to use Microsoft SQL Server(MSSQLExpressConnection in appsettings). If you also want to use MS SQL server( also Express server),
 just replace the connection string with yours.

```json
   "ConnectionStrings": {
      "DefaultConnection": "DataSource=app.db;Cache=Shared",
      "PostgresConnection": "User ID=postgres;Password=yourpass;Host=localhost;Port=5432;Database=parcel;Pooling=true;",
      "MSSQLExpressConnection": "Server=localhost\\SQLEXPRESS01;Database=parcel;Trusted_Connection=True;"
  },
```
If you wish to use other databases you also have to configure connection type in Startup.cs by changing options.something.
Different databases may need different NuGet packages installed.

```c#
//=============== Configure DB connection ===============
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
        {
            //=============== Configure DB connection ===============
            services.AddDbContext<AppDbContext>(options =>
                options.UseSqlServer(
                    Configuration.GetConnectionString("MSSQLExpressConnection")));
//=======================================================
```
## Install or update tooling
Run in ../ParcelSolution
```bash
dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef
dotnet tool update --global dotnet-ef
```

## Database managing
First command is for creating migrations for the database. Latest migrations are already applied for MSSQL DB. 
In case you need to delete them for other DBs, they are located in DAL.App.EF project. Just delete the migrations folder.

Second command creates/updates your database with coorect tables and restricts etc.
Third command is to delete existing DB from your server.
Run in ../ParcelSolution

```bash
dotnet ef migrations --project DAL.App.EF --startup-project WebApp add InitialDbCreation 
dotnet ef database update --project DAL.App.EF --startup-project WebApp
dotnet ef database drop --project DAL.App.EF --startup-project WebApp
```

## Starting back-end 
Run in ../ParcelSolution

```bash
dotnet run --project WebApp
```

Default localhost server is https://localhost:5001/
API documentation powered by Swagger can be found at https://localhost:5001/swagger/

# Getting front-end application to work

Navigate to project folder at ../parcel-client-app

## Installing neccessary packages

```bash
npm install
```

## Running the app
Start the app with

```bash
npm start
```

Default localhost is at http://localhost:3000/

# About the project in humanly way

Busy times but I tried my best with the little time I had. Hope all will work correctly(doubt).

## Front-End + react.ts

Simple parcel shipment app. You can see all shipments with all the details on main page. Also you can create new shipments there. On the editing page you can modify shipment, it's bags and add unassigned parcels. On parcels page you can create new parcels that will wait till they get put into bag/shipment.

## Back-end + .NET5.0

First time I used it since they merged.

Backend is quite big considering how small the test assignment was. That is because I used a base from my previous project as an starting point.
It uses repository pattern and is divided into different layers - domain, Data Access Layer(DAL), Business Logic Layer(BLL) and API itself.

Domain has all the models/entities with annotations. Used to generate migrations. 

DAL is the layer that commmunicates easily with the data source. It gets the data you ask for and maps it into usable entities/collections for programming environment. No hardcore business logic, just communication between DB and DAL. Every data repository inherits base methods as Save, Delete, Get etc., so we don't have to implement same basic operations for all of our entities. DAL is very much reusable in other applications.

Next Layer is BLL, where all the application spesific data manipulating happens. It does all the calculations/logic that is neccessary and maps it into Data Access Object for the API/DAL. It keeps the controllers very clean and avoids code duplication.

And then is the API and its controllers, pure request only, no unneccessary logic. Also Swagger support.

There is also Authntication/Identity support with jwt that I grabbed from my previous project, but I didn't make use of it for this assignment.
